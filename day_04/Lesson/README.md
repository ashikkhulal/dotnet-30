## Type Casting

Type casting is when you assign a value of one data to another type.

The values of certain data types are automatically converted to different data types in C#. This is called an implicit casting (conversion).

However, not all data types are implicitly converted to other data types. It must be specified explicitly.

In C#, there are two types of casting:

- **Implicit casting** (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
`char -> int -> long -> float -> double`

- **Explicit casting** (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
`double -> float -> long -> int -> char`

## Data-type conversion methods:

It is also possible to convert data types explicitly by using built-in methods, such as Convert.ToBoolean, Convert.ToDouble, Convert.ToString, Convert.ToInt32 (int), Convert.ToInt64 (long), etc.

## Operators:
